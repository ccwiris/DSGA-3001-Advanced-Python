    "An astrophysicist colleague was recently complaining about how long it was taking to run an N-body simulation. “It’s really just a simple calculation, and I’m only simulating four planets, but it takes nearly a minute and a half to run one simulation. I really need it done in under 30 seconds.” You kindly offer to take a look at code to see if it is possible to speed it up. Your colleague provides you with a link to the source: https://nyu-cds.github.io/courses/code/nbody.py\n",

This will ensure that it is possible to check the program is still working correctly after each change, and to assess the performance improvement that the change achieved. You are also aware that the program has to be maintained by others in the future, so you want to make sure that the changes do not make this more difficult, especially if the performance improvement is only minor.\n",
